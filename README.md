# TSCB-strategy

The Two-Step Clustering-Based (TSCB) strategy aims at improving the accuracy and time efficiency of traditional Bayesian network structure learning algorithms. By self-generating prior information about the existence of arcs, a wide range of traditional structure learning algorithms can benefit from the proposed strategy.

## Descriptions

This repository contains the code for implementing the TSCB strategy and experimental evaluations on synthetic datasets. The network data used by the evaluation can be downloaded from the `bnlearn` R package website, [Bayesian Network Repositiory](www.bnlearn.com/bnrepository/). The file, `Two-Step Clustering-Based Bayesian Network Structure Learning (Full Version)`, incorporates all the code from other files.
